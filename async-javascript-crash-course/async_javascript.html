    <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript Crash Course</h1>

    <p>The contents of this course are derived from the Asynchronous JavaScript Crash Course located on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exBgWAIeIeg&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhuX4qGvFx-wPy_MEi6Jdp7&index=7" target="_blank">The Codevolution YouTube Page.</a></p>

    <p>While this is not a completely exhaustive list, what follows is an extensive list of topics to get beginners going. I found a lot of value in the crash courses when I was first beginning to code and took extensive notes as I followed along. So, in coder fashion, I made websites out of the content and depoyed them through <a href="https://app.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a></p>

    <p>You can find the GitHub Repo with all of the code <a href="https://github.com/justinTsugranes/async-javascript-crash-course" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
