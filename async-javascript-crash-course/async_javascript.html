    <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript Crash Course</h1>

    <p>The contents of this course are derived from the Asynchronous JavaScript Crash Course located on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exBgWAIeIeg&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhuX4qGvFx-wPy_MEi6Jdp7&index=7" target="_blank">The Codevolution YouTube Page.</a></p>

    <p>While this is not a completely exhaustive list, what follows is an extensive list of topics to get beginners going. I found a lot of value in the crash courses when I was first beginning to code and took extensive notes as I followed along. So, in coder fashion, I made websites out of the content and depoyed them through <a href="https://app.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a></p>

<p>
  In its most basic form, JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded
  lanauge.
</p>

<h2>Synchronous</h2>

<p>
  Meaning...code executes from the top down, with only one line executing at any
  given time.
</p>

<h2>Blocking</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    No matter how long a previous previous takes, the subsequent processes
    won&#39;t begin until the former is completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If function A has to execute an intensive chunk of code, JavaScript has to
    finish that function before moving on to function B, regardless of the time
    it takes to complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web app runs in a browser and it executes an intesive chunk of code without
    returning control to the browser. The browser appears to be frozen.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Single-threaded</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    A thread is simply a process that your javascript program ca use to run a
    task
  </li>
  <li>Each thread can only do one task at a time</li>
  <li>
    JavaScript has just one thread called the main thread for executing any
    code.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript alone is not enough</p>

<p>
  We need new aspects which are outside of JavaScript to help us write
  asynchronous code, which is where web browsers come into play.
</p>

<p>
  Web browsers define functions and APIs that allow us to register functions
  that should not be executed synchronously, and hsould instead be invoked
  asynchronously when some kind of even occurs
</p>

<p>
  For example. that could be the passage of time (setTimeout or setInterval),
  the user&#39;s interaction wiht the mouse (addEventListener), or the arrival
  of data over the network (callbacks, Promises, async-await)
</p>

<p>
  You can let your code do several things at the same time without stopping or
  blocking your main thread.
</p>

<h3>Timeouts And Intervals</h3>

<p>
  These are the traditional methods that JavaScript has available for running
  code asynchronously
</p>

<ul>
  <li>setTimeout()</li>
  <li>setInterval()</li>
</ul>

<h4>setTimeout()</h4>

<p>
  The setTimeout() function executes a particular block of code once after a
  specified time has elapsed.
</p>

<p>Parameters that the setTimeout() function accepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The first paramter is a function to run, or a refernce to a function defined
    elsewhere
  </li>
  <li>
    The second paramter is a number representing the duration in milliseconds to
    wait before executing the code
  </li>
  <li>
    After the second paramter, you can pass in zero or more values that
    represent any paramters you want to pass to the function when it runs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Clearing timeouts</h5>

<p>Sometimes you may want to cancel or clear a timeout.</p>

<p>
  To clear a timeout, you can use the clearTimeOut() method, passing in the
  identifier returned by setTimeout as a parameter.
</p>

<img src="/async-javascript-crash-course/images/clearTimeout.jpg" alt="clearTimeout" height="250" width="450">

<p>
  In the image above, you can see that we assigned the return value from
  setTimeout to a constant called timeoutId. On line 6, we pass thatId into the
  clearTimeout method, which will basically ensure our grid function will not
  run after the two second duration. So, nothing is logged to the console as the
  grid function never executes.
</p>

<p>
  A more practical sceario is clearing timeouts when the component is unmounting
  to free up the resources and also prevent the code from incorrectly executing
  on an unmounted component.
</p>

<h4>setInterval()</h4>

<p>
  The setInterval() function repeatedly runs the ame code over and over again at
  regular intervals.
</p>

<img src="/async-javascript-crash-course/images/setInterval.1.jpg" alt="setInterval" height="75" width="400">

<p>Parameters that the setInterval() function accepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first parameter is the code to execute</li>
  <li>The second paamter is the duration in milliseconds</li>
  <li>
    After the second parameter, you can pass in zero or more values that
    represent any paramters you want to pass to the function when it is run
  </li>
</ul>
